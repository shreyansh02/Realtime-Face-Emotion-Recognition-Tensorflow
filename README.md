# Realtime-Face-Emotion-Recognition-Tensorflow

Large files codes and datasets in on my google drive (Github doesn't allow to push files more than 100MB)

In Google Drive, you will find the complete working codes, training & testing sets, and screenshots of working model

● The goal of the project is to perform Emotional Recognition through Facial Expressions using the Deep Learning model of
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

● We first begin pixelating the real-time image which is captured using the MobileNet V2 model, this model is mainly used for
enhancing resolution, performing object localization, and detection.

● Once feature extraction and image enhancement have been performed, we use our custom-built CNN architecture model
to predict the emotion expressed by the person or face captured.

● Emotional Recognition can be performed for a single face and multiple faces on the same screen.
